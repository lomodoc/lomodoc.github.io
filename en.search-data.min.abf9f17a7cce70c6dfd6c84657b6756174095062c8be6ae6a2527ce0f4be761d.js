The minimum set you need includes:\n Raspberry Pi board Power supply 16GB MicroSD card  A Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (PLUS) Starter Kit is good enough for the setup.\nThere are 3 options to install Lomorage service on Raspberry Pi, one is using the prebuild OS image which has all the dependencies installed, or you can run docker image on your existing running Raspberry Pi, or if you can just use APT install.\nInstall with prebuild OS image\r#\r\rThe prebuild image includes all Lomorage packages, including:\n  lomo-backend: Lomorage service backend\n  lomo-web: Lomorage web application\n  lomo-base: network configure tool, button control, hard drive mount tool (usbmount modification), bluetooth console\n  lomo-frame: the digital frame application\n  Click the link below to download the prebuild OS image.\nRaspberry Pi\rAfter you download the customized OS image, you can install the image to MicroSD card using balenaEtcher, which is available on both Windows and macOS.\nAfter you insert the MicroSD to your desktop or laptop, just select the image you download, choose the MicroSD drive, and click \u0026ldquo;Flash\u0026rdquo;, it will be done in a few minutes.\nAfter flushing the image, insert the microSD into Raspberry Pi board, connect USB hard drive with Raspberry Pi, plug in a network cable, plug in the power supply, turn on the power and wait a few minutes for system boot.\nIf you have HDMI connected, after system boot successfully, it will show up a screen that no able to find any assets, and will also show a QRCode for register the lomo frame, please create user on iOS/Android APP first before scanning the QRCode to bind the lomo frame. You can upload photos using Lomorage Phone app, and then press \u0026ldquo;r\u0026rdquo; to rescan.

and \u0026ldquo;[wifi-password]\u0026rdquo; with those of your wifi network; otherwise, you can refer to other docs online to set the WiFi connection.\n  Check IP address of primary Raspberry Pi    You can find the IP address using iPhone APP, in \u0026ldquo;settings\u0026rdquo; tab, section \u0026ldquo;LOCAL SERVICE\u0026rdquo;, the host field is the IP address.\n  Find the mount directory on primary Raspberry Pi    You can mount the \u0026ldquo;media\u0026rdquo; directory on primary Raspberry Pi onto your desktop/laptop via SAMBA, with user name \u0026ldquo;pi\u0026rdquo; and password \u0026ldquo;raspberry\u0026rdquo;, and you will find the directory name store media assets mounted under \u0026ldquo;media\u0026rdquo; directory.\n  Mount on Raspberry Pi zero w    Say if directory with name \u0026ldquo;/media/WD_90C27F73C27F5C82\u0026rdquo; store media assets mounted on primary Raspberry Pi (with IP 192.168.1.155), you can mount it on your Raspberry Pi zero w, login to Raspberry Pi zero and then:\nsudo mkdir /media/WD_90C27F73C27F5C82 echo \u0026#34;//192.168.1.124/media/WD_90C27F73C27F5C82 /media/WD_90C27F73C27F5C82 cifs user=pi,pass=raspberry,uid=1000,gid=1000\u0026#34;
